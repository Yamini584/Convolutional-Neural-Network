# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Covolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a part of deep learning, it is a class of deep neural networks.
CNN models train and test each input image, which will pass it through a series of convolution layers with filters (Kernals), Pooling, fully connected layers (FC).

This repository consists of code that demonstrates training a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images.

The CIFAR dataset is an in-built dataset of Tensorflow, which consists of 32 larger by 32 color images, and each photograph with three different color channels.
